# fRPC as an Oracular Prescription
Simple rpc commands would typically work, unless a node is blocking under metaedge absolutes.

To begin our journey at Earth being one anthroprogenically with people, and to project ourselves from one planet to the next, this type of alchemical network weaving can be attuned through philosophical cosmogony inquiries into the harmonious possessed by our solar system leading to a dome of Astroprivacy enhancing remote procedure calls.

While some solutions stand to be more complex, privately, or subjectively clever via routing, this may yield a negative function limit to the manifested architecture prescribed via Oracle interpretations for compute expectation healing, or individual divine Rotator functions.

# TODOs
- tests and service definition
- if you've been in blockchain for >1 year with prior web2 knowledge, this repo is possible to complete
